PROBLEM STATEMENT-

Your Friend is a real estate agent and wants some help predicting housing prices for the USA region. It would be great if you create a model for him that allows him to put in a few features of a house and returns back an estimate of what the house would sell for.
he has asked you for help ,you help him with your newly learn data science skills. and decide that Linear Regression might be a good path to solve this problem!
Your Friend then gives you some information about houses in regions of the United States,it is all in the data set: USA_Housing.csv.
